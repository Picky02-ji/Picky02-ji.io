# Record and recall

### 22/6/16 big big sun with the highset temperature at 37 degrees

## Today's time

This morning as usual, having a CPP class, and I as usual listened to it not seriously. I think in 
my mind that I should listrn to it seriously or do my own thing seriou, but most of the time I 
aimlessly do nothing and watch the short video. 

Thankfully I learned English this noon by watching **The Economist** on **bilibili**. It's fantastic. 
And I think I can keep on watching it every day. Superadd the every day's vercabulary and every's 
diary my English will boost in the future!

This afternoon, I review my **DS**, and at now I think it's really a waste of time, because it's so 
easy! It's better more to do some algorithm's practice. But it's time to review what I had learned 
the first half of term. Something associated with tree and graph.

After this diary, I should do the project attach with **SICP**, which also named **hog**. 

## Memories

When I was at high school where is a boy who's last name is Zhang. Some days he was my deskmate. 
That really a nice day and not only about this but alse about the environment. The college is less 
unforggetable than high school and less struggling.

new day's nonsense.
