# After braking the promise

### 22/6/19 good day and happy

## The happy from **lanqiao-cup**

It's been a long time from I participated in the **lanqiao-cup** and so to start my algorithm's learning. It's the first time I coding day and night though 
not very skilled, I stiil miss that day. But this day I almost forget it and do nothing about algorithm. It's a totally wrong. And I haven't write my English 
diary and listen to English and English vercabulary, it's a pretty bad behavior.

So from this day on, I keep on doing this, maybe one day break, but always call myself back: 
- EveryDay's podcast at morning and dusk.
- Everyday's English contact and vercabulary at lunch break. 
- Everyday's review for exam at afternoon and night. 
- Everyday's coding at afternoon and night. 

If I'm tired about the book it's time to code something.

## What I should review?

- JSP and the Environment
- Computer Composing Principle

## What I can learn and read?

- algorithm plan (coding)
- SICP project (4' coding)
- domo about algorithm (reading)
- ~~pattern (not now!)~~
- ICS HW, Lab; OS book, HW, Lab

...keep your mind and don't waste time.
